Overview

The Shadow Evaluator is an AI-powered governance tool designed to solve a critical problem in higher education: grading inconsistency and accreditation risk. Using a sophisticated Multi-Agent architecture, the system "shadows" human faculty evaluations to ensure every student is graded fairly and against the same global benchmarks.
The Multi-Agent "Brain"

Unlike a single AI model, our system uses a Collaborative Agentic Workflow:

     Governance Officer Agent: Ensures the evaluation follows university compliance and accreditation standards.

     Quant Analyst Agent: Deep-dives into numerical data to detect statistical outliers or "grade inflation."

     Blind Judge Agent: Performs a qualitative, unbiased "blind" review of the student's work.

     Orchestrator Agent: Synthesizes the feedback from all agents to produce a final "Z-Score" (Variance Analysis).

Why It Matters

    Eliminates Bias: The "Blind Judge" agent doesn't know the student's background.

    Accreditation Evidence: Generates a downloadable "Accreditation Evidence" report for every audit.

    Scalability: Universities can audit 1,000+ courses in seconds, a task that would take human committees months.
